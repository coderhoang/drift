# Drift Game
## Description
### A simple Drift Game made from HTML CSS and JS!
## Dying and obstacles
### There are 2 major obstacles (wall, and "black holes"), and 3 ways to die (touching a wall, touching the center of the black holes, going out of screen)
## How to play
### Drag your mouse to drift, your goal is to make it to the other side of the screen (the green circle)
### There will be obstacles as the game progresses!
## What inspired you to create it?
### Well, the first reason why I decided to make it space themed is because I wanted to register the project in the Space Theme event in Hackclub
### I love playing pool as an online game, so I figured to turn the pool game into something even better
